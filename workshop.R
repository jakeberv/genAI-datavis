data(package = 'palmerpenguins')

# this loads two R objects into the R workspace
# they are in Tidyverse tibble format

## lets convert them to standard R data frame
penguins_df <- as.data.frame(penguins)

#ChatGPT 4o output
"The dataset penguins_df is a data frame in R containing 344 observations and 8 variables. Here is a summary of the data structure:

species: Factor with 3 levels - "Adelie", "Chinstrap", and another level. This variable indicates the species of penguins.
island: Factor with 3 levels - "Biscoe", "Dream", and another level. This variable indicates the island where the penguin was found.
bill_length_mm: Numeric variable indicating the bill length in millimeters. There are some missing values (NA).
bill_depth_mm: Numeric variable indicating the bill depth in millimeters. There are some missing values (NA).
flipper_length_mm: Integer variable indicating the flipper length in millimeters. There are some missing values (NA).
body_mass_g: Integer variable indicating the body mass in grams. There are some missing values (NA).
sex: Factor with 2 levels - "female" and "male". This variable indicates the sex of the penguin. There are some missing values (NA).
year: Integer variable indicating the year of observation.
This structure suggests the dataset is well-suited for statistical analysis or machine learning tasks involving categorical and continuous variables related to penguin characteristics."

#OK - 
#now we have a nice description of the data set and how it is organized. What might we want to do with it?

#Step 1 -- clean the data

#Let's assume we don't want to do any kind of missing data estimation and will just want to work with a 'clean' dataset

"Sure! Here are some ideas for visualizing how body size varies across different islands, accounting for species and sex, using the penguins_df dataset:

Boxplots:

Body Mass by Island and Species: Create a boxplot with body mass on the y-axis, islands on the x-axis, and use different colors to represent species. You can also use facets to separate plots by sex.

Heatmaps:

Heatmap of Body Mass: Create a heatmap where the rows represent islands, columns represent species, and the color intensity represents the average body mass. Use separate heatmaps for each sex.

Density Plot: 

Create density plots for body mass for each island, separated by species and colored by sex."

## and so on -- 
## you can see how generating a custom plotting function allows us to quickly explore different dimensions of the data

## you could do this with ggplot etc, but with genAI, you dont need to, just write a function to parse and plot the data in the way that is most useful to you.


### section 2 ###

####
#### Lets try another example:
#Recall our dataset
str(penguins_cleaned)
## Ok now, lets try something a bit more sophisticated.
## Let's say, we want to know what the relationship between bill length and flipper length looks like, but we want to compare this across species. In this case, we want to fit linear models for each species, and plot the results. The plot should give us useful information.

## starting from a fresh session

## This time, I will include all of the function iterations to show the process I go through.

#So, let's give GPT the structure of the object, as before, and describe the goal.
"I am working with an R data object that looks like this

I want to know what the relationship between bill length and flipper length looks like, but I want to compare this across species. I want to write an R function that takes the input data object, and user arguments for pairs of specific traits. The function will filter the dataset by species, and fit linear models to each pair of traits. Then, it will plot a scatterplot of the results, per species, with each species as a different colored poitns. It will lastly add the inferred regression lines.

Ensure you understand the task. Explain it back to me before proceeding and I will check your logic."

## this time, I will use chain of thought prompting to try to get the LLM to follow a multi-step procedure and generate a plotting function that does more than one thing at time. This last sentence really helps to ensure that the model is crystal clear about what you want.

#Here is GPT's response
"Certainly! Here’s a breakdown of the task:

Input: An R data frame (similar to penguins_cleaned) and user-specified pairs of traits (e.g., bill length and flipper length).
Filtering and Modeling:
The function will filter the dataset by species.
For each species, it will fit a linear model to the specified pair of traits (e.g., bill_length_mm and flipper_length_mm).

Plotting:
Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between the two specified traits for each species.
Use different colors for each species.
Add the regression lines inferred from the linear models to the plot.
Here’s the step-by-step plan to achieve this in R:

Function Definition: Create a function that takes the data frame and two trait names as input arguments.
Data Filtering: Within the function, filter the data by species.
Linear Model Fitting: Fit a linear model to the specified traits for each species.

Plotting:
Generate a scatter plot with different colors for each species.
Add regression lines to the plot, one for each species."

## this generates a plot but throws an error-- it seems to be related to the linear regressions

## upon examining the code, we see it is likely related to the model fitting.

"There is an error:

Error in eval(predvars, data, env) : object 'bill_length_mm' not found

{"Call:
This indicates the formula used for the linear model and the dataset.

Residuals:
These are the differences between the observed and predicted values. The five-number summary (Min, 1Q, Median, 3Q, Max) provides a quick snapshot of the distribution of residuals:

Min: -24.8669
1Q (1st Quartile): -3.4617
Median: -0.0765
3Q (3rd Quartile): 3.7020
Max: 15.9944
Coefficients:
This section provides estimates of the model parameters, their standard errors, t-values, and p-values.

Interpreting the Coefficients:
(Intercept):

Estimate: 147.5633
Std. Error: 4.2234
t value: 34.940
Pr(>|t|): < 2e-16
Interpretation: The intercept represents the estimated value of flipper_length_mm for the reference species (Adelie) when bill_length_mm is 0. The intercept is highly significant (p < 2e-16).
bill_length_mm:

Estimate: 1.0957
Std. Error: 0.1081
t value: 10.139
Pr(>|t|): < 2e-16
Interpretation: For each additional millimeter in bill_length_mm, the flipper_length_mm increases by approximately 1.0957 mm for the reference species (Adelie). This effect is highly significant (p < 2e-16).
speciesChinstrap:

Estimate: -5.2470
Std. Error: 1.3797
t value: -3.803
Pr(>|t|): 0.00017
Interpretation: Chinstrap penguins have an average flipper_length_mm that is 5.2470 mm less than Adelie penguins, holding bill_length_mm constant. This difference is statistically significant (p = 0.00017).
speciesGentoo:

Estimate: 17.5517
Std. Error: 1.1883
t value: 14.771
Pr(>|t|): < 2e-16
Interpretation: Gentoo penguins have an average flipper_length_mm that is 17.5517 mm more than Adelie penguins, holding bill_length_mm constant. This difference is highly significant (p < 2e-16).
Significance Codes:
The stars next to the p-values indicate the level of significance:

***: p < 0.001
**: p < 0.01
*: p < 0.05
.: p < 0.1
: p >= 0.1
Residual Standard Error:
5.833 on 329 degrees of freedom: The typical size of the residuals (errors) is 5.833 mm. The degrees of freedom (329) indicates the number of observations minus the number of parameters estimated.
Multiple R-squared and Adjusted R-squared:
Multiple R-squared: 0.8283
Adjusted R-squared: 0.8268
Interpretation: These values indicate that approximately 82.83% of the variability in flipper_length_mm is explained by the model, adjusted for the number of predictors. This suggests a good fit.
F-statistic:
529.2 on 3 and 329 DF
p-value: < 2.2e-16
Interpretation: The overall model is highly significant (p < 2.2e-16), indicating that at least one of the predictors (bill_length_mm or species) significantly predicts flipper_length_mm.
Summary:
The relationships between bill_length_mm and flipper_length_mm differ significantly between the species.
The interaction terms (i.e., species effects) show that both Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins have significantly different flipper_length_mm compared to Adelie penguins, even when controlling for bill_length_mm.
The model explains a large proportion of the variance in flipper_length_mm, suggesting a strong relationship between the traits and species."}

### Your task

For each row, I would like to visualize three density plots, one for each island, and a user-specified trait. The plots represent the values for all species on each island for the specified trait.

The goal is to write a function that wraps around the ggplot code and allows the user to easily generate the described figure.

Study my instructions, and then describe the task step by step. Then wait for further instructions.
